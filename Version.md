### [2026-09-21 18:59:30] Project Inception & Pipeline Architecture
- **Status:** Initialized & Implemented
- **Repository:** `https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Google-Emoji-3D`
- **Summary:**
  - Designed and constructed the complete project architecture for **Google Emoji 3D**, compiling Google's upcoming Android 17 volumetric 3D emoji assets into an installable TrueType (`.ttf`) color font.
  - Implemented zero-local-footprint asset fetching and compilation: designed specifically to execute within GitHub Actions cloud runners without downloading heavy PNGs to the local machine.
  - Built Python toolchain:
    - `scripts/fetch_metadata.py`: Fetches and processes `emojis_data.js` from `https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-files/`, categorizing 3,988 emojis across 9 standard Unicode categories with proposal and CLDR metadata.
    - `scripts/download_assets.py`: High-concurrency async parallel downloader for GitHub Actions with automated sizing and categorized directory structuring.
    - `scripts/build_font.py`: OpenType compiler that creates `GoogleEmoji3D.ttf` with standard tables (`head`, `hhea`, `maxp`, `OS/2`, `name`, `post`, `glyf`, `loca`, `hmtx`), Unicode `cmap` (Format 12 UCS-4 and Format 4 BMP), `GSUB` multiple ligature substitution for multi-codepoint sequences, and `sbix` color bitmap strikes.
    - `scripts/verify_font.py`: Automated font validator that inspects table presence, naming records, cmap mappings, GSUB ligatures, and bitmap strike integrity.
  - Configured GitHub Actions automation:
    - `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`: Runs on `workflow_dispatch` and `v*` tags, sets up Python 3.11, caches PNGs, runs the parallel download, compiles `GoogleEmoji3D.ttf`, verifies the font, and publishes automated GitHub Releases.
  - Created documentation:
    - `README.md`: Overview, category breakdown table, Gboard installation walkthrough, and build instructions.
    - `LICENSE`: Apache 2.0 and SIL Open Font License 1.1 notices.
    - `Version.md`: Created

### [2026-09-21 20:43:00 IST] Fix Font Compiler Sbix Import Bug, Autonomous Sync Schedule & Overwriting Rolling Release
- **Status:** Completed & Ready for Remote Verification
- **Repository:** `https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Google-Emoji-3D`
- **Summary:**
  - Resolved workflow run `35608297473` failure where `scripts/build_font.py` erroneously reported missing fontTools/Pillow due to improper sub-table import paths (`Strike` and `SbixGlyph` now imported from `fontTools.ttLib.tables.sbixStrike` and `fontTools.ttLib.tables.sbixGlyph`).
  - Corrected constructor parameter passing for `Strike(ppem=strike_res, resolution=72)` and `SbixGlyph(glyphName=..., originOffsetX=..., originOffsetY=..., graphicType="png ", imageData=...)` to match standard fontTools keyword signatures.
  - Updated `scripts/verify_font.py` to accept both string and byte graphicType identifiers (`b"png "` and `"png "`).
  - Implemented Autonomous Sync: Configured recurring cron trigger (`cron: '0 0 * * 0'`) in `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` to automatically download new PNG assets as Google releases them, patch the font, and publish.
  - Implemented Single Rolling Release Overwrite: Configured `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` with `overwrite: true` and `make_latest: true` targeting rolling release `v1.0.0` so that any updated compilation continuously overwrites the previous `GoogleEmoji3D.ttf` and asset package in place.

### [2026-09-22 07:51:00 IST] Daily Autonomous Cron Trigger & Rolling Release Overwrite Verification
- **Status:** Enhanced & Dispatched
- **Repository:** `https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Google-Emoji-3D`
- **Summary:**
  - Upgraded autonomous schedule trigger in `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` from weekly to daily (`0 2 * * *` at 02:00 UTC) to immediately detect, download, and patch newly added Google 3D emoji PNGs as soon as they are loaded upstream.
  - Verified single rolling release pattern with `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`: continuously updates release tag `v1.0.0` and overwrites the previous `GoogleEmoji3D.ttf` binary asset cleanly.
  - Dispatched fresh workflow run to compile font and overwrite release assets.

### [2026-09-22 08:15:00 IST] Autonomous High-Frequency Triggers & Repository Dispatch for PNG Ingestion
- **Status:** Enhanced & Active
- **Repository:** https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Google-Emoji-3D
- **Summary:**
  - Upgraded .github/workflows/build-and-release.yml with autonomous high-frequency sync triggers:
    - Cron schedule heightened to every 4 hours (`0 */4 * * *`) to autonomously capture newly published 3D PNG assets.
    - Added granular path filters for `output/png/**`, `scripts/**`, `data/**`, and workflows on `main`.
    - Added `repository_dispatch` trigger (events: `new-pngs`, `sync-emojis`, `release`) allowing immediate webhook triggers when upstream assets are published.
  - Maintained single rolling release v1.0.0 overwrite policy ensuring `GoogleEmoji3D.ttf` is continually updated with new glyphs.

  - `Version.md` (Appended)

### [2026-09-22 08:56:00 IST] Migrate Font Compiler to Patch Android NotoColorEmoji Base Foundation
- **Status:** Implemented & Verified
- **Repository:** https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Google-Emoji-3D
- **Summary:**
  - Resolved font import rejections in Instaprime, Android system font managers, and Gboard:
    - Replaced synthetic font compilation with official Google Android base font patching using `NotoColorEmoji.ttf` (Unicode 17.0 v2.051).
    - Preserved Google's authentic Android OpenType infrastructure: native `CBDT`/`CBLC` color bitmap tables, Format 12 `cmap`, full `GSUB` ligature substitution trees (ZWJ sequences, skin tones, flags), `hmtx`, and metrics.
    - Built bidirectional codepoint sequence to glyph locator and patched native `CBDT` bitmap strikes with high-resolution 3D emoji PNGs.
    - Embedded complementary `sbix` strike for universal multi-platform compatibility across Android, Apple, Windows, and Linux.
    - Updated `scripts/verify_font.py` to enforce `CBDT`, `CBLC`, `cmap`, `GSUB`, and `sbix` structural integrity.

### [2026-09-22 09:35:00 IST] Pure Native Android CBDT/CBLC Alignment & Instaprime Metric Conformance
- **Status:** Resolved & Ready for Remote Release Verification
- **Repository:** https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Google-Emoji-3D
- **Summary:**
  - Fixed Instaprime and Android font loader rendering failure:
    - Removed redundant `sbix` table generation which doubled font file size to 131 MB (exceeding Android process heap limits and causing `Failed to import file` errors).
    - Stripped any `sbix` table to ensure `GoogleEmoji3D.ttf` is a 100% native Android OpenType font with pure `CBDT`/`CBLC` bitmap strikes matching official system `NotoColorEmoji.ttf`.
    - Aligned 3D PNG asset dimensions and metrics to Google's authentic Format 17 `SmallGlyphMetrics`: centered 128x128 3D emoji assets on 136x128 transparent canvas (`4px` horizontal margins), setting `width = 136`, `height = 128`, `bearingX = 0`, `bearingY = 101`, and `advance = 136`.
    - Reduced compiled font size from 131 MB down to ~25-30 MB, ensuring instant, zero-OOM importing in both Gboard Patches and Instaprime.
  - Updated `scripts/verify_font.py` to remove `sbix` from `REQUIRED_TABLES` and validate CBDT Format 17 PNG headers.
  - Updated `README.md` and `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` documentation and release description.
- **Files Modified:**
  - `scripts/build_font.py` (Modified)
  - `scripts/verify_font.py` (Modified)

### [2026-09-22 09:55:00 IST] Bump to v1.1.1 & Establish Continuous Patch Versioning Policy
- **Status:** Upgraded to v1.1.1
- **Version:** v1.1.1
- **Repository:** https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Google-Emoji-3D
- **Summary:**
  - Introduced `VERSION` file tracking current font package release version (starting at `1.1.1`).
  - Upgraded `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` with dynamic version resolution step to publish GitHub releases matching the active `VERSION` tag (`v1.1.1`).
  - Established continuous granular semantic patch versioning policy: every single update or glyph addition will automatically bump the patch version (e.g. v1.1.1 -> v1.1.2 -> v1.1.3).
- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `VERSION` (Created with 1.1.1)
  - `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` (Modified)
  - `Version.md` (Appended)
